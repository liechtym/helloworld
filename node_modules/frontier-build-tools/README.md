### Developing

Running tests:

    npm test
    
To test changes to the tools in your project, npm link this project in the app you want to test. 
For example, if I wanted to test changes to the i18n:pseudo task in the indexing app

From the frontier-build-tools directory:

    npm link
    
From the indexing app directory:

    npm link frontier-build-tools
    
Then running cake i18n:pseudo in the indexing app will reflect current changes the frontier-build-tools source

When finished testing, unlink frontier-build-tools from the app and re-install it.

From the indexing app directory:

    npm unlink frontier-build-tools
    npm install
